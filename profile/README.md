# kawaii-kode

Welcome to **kawaii-kode**, a small, passionate community of friends and developers dedicated to bringing our creative projects to life. We are an informal group of developers who come together around 2010 to explore our love for programming and technology. Through our projects, we focus on learning, collaboration and creating small-scale applications with a personal touch. We work primarily on projects intended for personal use or small user groups and we strive to keep things fun and light-hearted. Though we come from different backgrounds, we share a deep passion for coding and are united by our goal of learning and building something meaningful together.
